# Contributing

## Guidelines

- **Only Rust-powered Python projects.** The project must have a meaningful Rust component (not just a thin wrapper around a C library).
- **One project per pull request.**
- **Use the format:** `[project-name](https://github.com/...) - Description.`
  - Description should start with a capital letter and end with a period.
  - Keep descriptions concise (one sentence).
- **Place the project in the appropriate category.** If no category fits, propose a new one.
- **Check that the project is actively maintained** and has a reasonable number of stars/users.
- **No duplicates.** Search existing entries before submitting.
